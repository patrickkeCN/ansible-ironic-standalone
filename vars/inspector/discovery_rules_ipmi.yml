# Rules to apply when a new node is discovered
# http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic-inspector/http-api.html
# https://github.com/openstack/ironic-inspector/blob/master/doc/source/usage.rst

# NOTE: If you change a rule but not its name, it wont be applied
# because the Ansible task only checks if it exists by name, not by
# the content. You can delete all the rules before running ansible with
# curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5050/v1/rules
# or fill the UUID of the rules in the variable defined at the bottom
# of the file discovery_rules.yml. (the intention behind that file is
# define your custom rules)
# You can check the rules defined with curl -X GET http://localhost:5050/v1/rules


# Define the IPMI seetings for the new nodes
